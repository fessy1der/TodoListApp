# TodoListApp
This is a basic Todo list app made with HTML, CSS, JS. Since there is no authentication in this project, with the help of JS i made sure that the TODO items remain same after the browser is refreshed or relaunched by caching the items to the browser. 

This project will be extended in another repo that will be reworked to contain user authentication and also ensuring that the ToDo items are added and retrieved  from the database.
